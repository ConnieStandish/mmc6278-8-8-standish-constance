// Your code here
//Pseudocode:
//Objective: Create a weather app that diplays current weather data by location
//Note: First create an OpenWeather API account and visit the API key management page

//1. The weather app should call to Open Weather API's current endpoint using JavaScript Fetch API

//2. To receive full credit the app must display: city/country code, Google Maps link, weather icon, description of current weather, actual temp., perceived temp., time weather info was last updated. 

//3. If user enters data that does not retrieve weather data it should display 'location not found'

//4. To obtain weather data from API, construct URL for request using JavaScript.

//5. Add an extra parameter to ensure measurements are imperial units.

//6. Use string concatenation to ensure that user entered data will be pulled. 

//7. Additional steps to take when setting up icon, time updated, and Google maps link.
